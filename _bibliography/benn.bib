	abstract = {Neuroimaging non-human primates (NHPs) is a growing, yet highly specialized field of neuroscience. Resources that were primarily developed for human neuroimaging often need to be significantly adapted for use with NHPs or other animals, which has led to an abundance of custom, in-house solutions. In recent years, the global NHP neuroimaging community has made significant efforts to transform the field towards more open and collaborative practices. Here we present the PRIMatE Resource Exchange (PRIME-RE), a new collaborative online platform for NHP neuroimaging. PRIME-RE is a dynamic community-driven hub for the exchange of practical knowledge, specialized analytical tools, and open data repositories, specifically related to NHP neuroimaging. PRIME-RE caters to both researchers and developers who are either new to the field, looking to stay abreast of the latest developments, or seeking to collaboratively advance the field.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},

	abstract = {The microbial production of ethanol (bioethanol) is a massive commercialized technology. Though alcohols with longer carbon chains are chemically much better suited for current transportation needs, their biotechnological production remains challenging. Here we have engineered the model hyperthermophile Pyrococcus furiosus to produce various alcohols from their corresponding organic acids by constructing a synthetic route termed the AOR/AdhA pathway. Our study is also the first example, to our knowledge, of significant alcohol formation in an archaeon, emphasizing the biotechnological potential of novel microorganisms. Moreover, we show that carbon monoxide and hydrogen (syngas) can be used as the driving forces for alcohol production. The application of the AOR/AdhA pathway in syngas-fermenting microorganisms is potentially a game-changing platform technology for the production of longer bioalcohols.Bioethanol production is achieved by only two metabolic pathways and only at moderate temperatures. Herein a fundamentally different synthetic pathway for bioalcohol production at 70 {\textdegree}C was constructed by insertion of the gene for bacterial alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhA) into the archaeon Pyrococcus furiosus. The engineered strain converted glucose to ethanol via acetate and acetaldehyde, catalyzed by the host-encoded aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase (AOR) and heterologously expressed AdhA, in an energy-conserving, redox-balanced pathway. Furthermore, the AOR/AdhA pathway also converted exogenously added aliphatic and aromatic carboxylic acids to the corresponding alcohol using glucose, pyruvate, and/or hydrogen as the source of reductant. By heterologous coexpression of a membrane-bound carbon monoxide dehydrogenase, CO was used as a reductant for converting carboxylic acids to alcohols. Redirecting the fermentative metabolism of P. furiosus through strategic insertion of foreign genes creates unprecedented opportunities for thermophilic bioalcohol production. Moreover, the AOR/AdhA pathway is a potentially game-changing strategy for syngas fermentation, especially in combination with carbon chain elongation pathways.},
