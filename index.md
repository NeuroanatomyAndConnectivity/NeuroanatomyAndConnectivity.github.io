# Welcome
This is the website of the Neuroanatomy & Connectivity Lab, headed by [Daniel Margulies][DSM].  

We investigate principles of how the cerebral cortex is spatially organized and the role of that organization in human cognition. More information about various projects and [publications] are available on our [research page].  

We're based at the [Institut de Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière][ICM] in Paris, and associated with the [Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS)][CNRS]. From 2012-2017 we were an independent research group at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences][NAC] in [Leipzig].
