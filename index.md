# Welcome
This is the website of the Neuroanatomy & Connectivity Lab, headed by [Daniel Margulies][DSM].  

We investigate principles of how the cerebral cortex is spatially organized and the role of that organization in human cognition. More information about various projects are available on our [research] and [publications] pages.  

We're based at the [Integrative Neuroscience & Cognition Center][INCC] (INCC -- UMR 8002) at the [University of Paris][UofP], and associated with the [Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS)][CNRS]. From 2012&ndash;2017 we were an independent research group at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences][NAC] in [Leipzig], and from 2018&ndash;2020 we were based at the [Institut de Cerveau et de la Moelle épinière][ICM] in Paris.
