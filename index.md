# Welcome

We investigate principles of how the cerebral cortex is spatially organized and the role of that organization in human cognition. More information about our various projects is available on the [research] and [publications] pages.  

[![]({{site.baseurl}}/thumbnails/image1.jpg){: .right .half}]({{site.baseurl}}/gallery/index.html)  

The lab is led by [Daniel Margulies][DSM] and based at the [Integrative Neuroscience & Cognition Center][INCC] (INCC -- UMR 8002) at the [University of Paris][UofP] and [Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS)][CNRS] as well as the [Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging][WIN] at [Oxford University][Oxford]. From 2012&ndash;2017 we were an independent research group at the [Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences][NAC] in [Leipzig], and from 2018&ndash;2020 we were based at the [Paris Brain Institute][ICM].
