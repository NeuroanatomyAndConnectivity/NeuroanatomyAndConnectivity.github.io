| **Doctoral student** |  
| I grew up in Rome but soon moved to study psychology and cognitive neuroscience at the universities of Bologna and Padova. My initial research work investigates the changes of cortical morphology associated with undernourishment. I joined the lab to study how spatial relationships in cortical anatomy prime (and constrain) the functional organization of the lateral parietal cortex. My interests include art, music, and really anything that gives me the chance to be creative and learn something new. |
