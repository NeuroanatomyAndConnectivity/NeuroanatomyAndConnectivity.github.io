# Austin Benn
[![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Benn.jpg){: .left .round .small}](/people/benn.html)
**Posterdoctoral Researcher**  

Austin joined the lab after completing his PhD in Madrid where he used functional and structural connectivity to create cross-species translations between the pig and human. He still studies cortical organisation, but is now interested in macro-scale trends that generalise across species, but also provide insight into the organisational principles of the human brain. When not in the lab you'll find him at the local hockey rink, or learning to surf.
