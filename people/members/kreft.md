# Vincent Kreft  
[![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/Kreft.jpg){: .left .round .small}](/members/kreft.html)

| **Research Intern** |   
| I am a science-passionate, hard-working, and collaborative UC Berkeley student intrigued by the chemical processes of the body. I am also an environmental enthusiast who understands that planetary health and human health are interrelated, and my long-term goal is to conduct medical research that answers questions at that intersection. I enjoy playing jazz piano improvisations, hiking atop mountains, and working through a good neuroscience coding & debugging session.  |
