| **Doctoral student** |  
| I am interested in understanding the principles of brain organization (on both circuit and systems level) that enable the emergence of different behaviours and cognitive abilities. I use computational models and existing datasets for that. Prev work includes studying hippocampal contributions to the processing of hierarchical structures using fMRI and looking at role of the OFC using RL. Further interests: Memory Engrams, Critical Periods, Genetics, Evolution, Innate priors, ASD & SZ and AI. |
