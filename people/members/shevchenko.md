| **Research Assistant** |  
| Born in Kamchatka, raised in Moscow, I discovered cognitive science at the University of Helsinki, Finland. In this lab, I seek to gain insight into the intrinsic functional hierarchy of the human cortex and to further our understanding of how human cognition is constrained by it. More generally, I love to make things work through research and to share knowledge with others. My leisure-time activities include practice of Ashtanga yoga, playing the piano and enjoying Paris, of course. |
